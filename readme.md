   -  At Research Square Comapny I work with a team of excellent engineers, maintaining a large internal php and react application that is used by hundreds of team members daily. The app is built on Domain Driven Design principles with domain events and docker containers. The react pages interact with a php backend and provide a more responsive means to interact with the app. I largely develop new interfaces with react, and maintain exisitng php architecture. <br /> *<b>This is all hidden in private repos</b>*
  -  Convero is a bulk animated image compressor cli built using php. <br />  *<b>The source is all [here](https://github.com/techyowl/convero)</b>*
  -  Privuma is a multimedia cacher/api that was designed to be a drop in replacement for Google Photos compatible api. It has a simple filesystem queue for processing media items against ffmpeg and any rclone compatible cloud provider. It is also extendable through the use of writing plugins to grab data from new sources. It also uses a database to keep track of duplicates. <br />  *<b>The source is all [here](https://github.com/techyowl/privuma).</b>*
  -  Shopify Ultimate Component is a drop in shopify section that allows you to quickly create one pager style pages with support for css animations, disruptive horizons, video backgrounds, background overlays, and various spacing and layout customization options. <br />  *<b>The source is all [here](https://github.com/techyowl/shopify-ultimate-component).</b>*
  -  Featheread is a php based social network that allows authors to publish pdf books one chapter at a time and gain a following to pursue publication of physical books. <br />  *<b>This is all hidden in private repos</b>*
  -  Cache is a ios(swift) and php backend social network that allows users to find and place images and videos into a geolocation based virtual world. You find caches just by walking near a geotagged photo or video and can view the post when you next open the application. This was kind of a passive social network idea. It also featured public city/region based chatting. <br />  *<b>This is all hidden in private repos</b>*

### Here's some more about me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React and Symfony (API Platform) frameworks.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on CLI projects that improve productivity. These tools are fun to build, useful and are different enough from my daily work. 
- ðŸ¤” What I want to learn next: My 2022 goal is to dive deep into Virtual Reality based projects from learning modeling in blender to maybe writing a basic game.
